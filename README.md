# Watts Migrate module (watts_migrate)
This is a custom module for Drupal 7 to 9 custom migrations, specifically aimed at websites at Arizona State University that are built on the WebSpark custom install profile.

##Installation and use
This module can be installed via Composer, or manually at /modules/custom.

##Acknowledgements
This module is heavily based on the work of Brian Tofte-Schumacher from Forum-One. You can learn about his approach in his presentation at 2020 DrupalCamp Asheville, 'Migration Deep-dive: Panelizer to Layout Builder' (https://youtu.be/1WQ7KJ9_iu8). Brian was gracious enough to share the original code with me, which is the only way this project was able to get off the ground.
